# üìöüêô Bookmarklets library

The repository for keeping bookmarklets.

Unfortunetly on Github's markdown you cannot simply add comfortable links, so you have to drag and drop (on the bookmarks' bar) the code by yourself.

## Bookmarklets

### Explain XKCD

If you are on [xkcd](https://xkcd.com), it will redirect you on the proper subpage on the [explain xkcd wiki](https://www.explainxkcd.com/). Otherwise display the alert.

```bookmarklet
javascript:(function()%7Blet%20url%3Dwindow.location.href%2Cregex%3D%2Fhttps%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Fxkcd%5C.com%5C%2F(%5Cd%2B)%5C%2F%2F%2Cmatch%3Durl.match(regex)%3Bmatch%3Fwindow.location.href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fww.explainxkcd.com%2Fwiki%2Findex.php%2F%22%2Bmatch%5B1%5D%3Aalert(%22That%20is%20not%20a%20XKCD%20page%22)%3B%7D)()
```
